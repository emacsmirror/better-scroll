# better-scroll
> Improve user experience when scrolling window.

[![CI](https://github.com/jcs-elpa/better-scroll/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/jcs-elpa/better-scroll/actions/workflows/test.yml)

Normally scroll up/down will move the cursor to the window boundary corresponding to
the direction on how the window scrolls. This package provides it's own scrolling
functions that will preserve cursor's position.

## Usage

There are total 4 interactive functions in this package.

* `better-scroll-down`
* `better-scroll-up`
* `better-scroll-down-other-window`
* `better-scroll-up-other-window`

I will recommend to bind these function to global keys like the snippet below.

```el
(define-key global-map (kbd "<prior>") #better-scroll-down)
(define-key global-map (kbd "<next>") #better-scroll-up)

(define-key global-map (kbd "S-<prior>") #better-scroll-down-other-window)
(define-key global-map (kbd "S-<next>") #better-scroll-up-other-window)
```

*P.S. `<prior>` and `<next>` is corresponds to `page up` and `page down` key.*

### Aligment

You can set the cursor aligment by tweaking `better-scroll-align-type` variable.

```el
(setq better-scroll-align-type 'center)  ; 'center or 'relative
```
